### Introduction

Hi, welcome to my blog, I am Fergus, currently a 2nd year computer science students. In this blog post I'm going to first go over a brief background of myself, then I will talk about the technologies I uses and learnt. And finally I will go off track and talk about my hobbies. And also I will talk about why I built this blog at the end.

### Background

I came from Hong Kong and now based in Durham, studying a degree in computer science in Durham University. My relationship with technology started quite young, when I was a child, around 5 years old, I have been introduced to the world of computer by my cousin. And since then I have been some what addicted to this wonderful technology. My interest in programming grew with the increasing amount of time I spent on the computer, playing games like Minecraft and Counter-Strike, wondering how do one create a programe from scratch. At around 15 years old, I decided to teach myself Python as a preparation for ICT. And I fell in love with the process of identifying the problem and solving the problem. I stuck around and kept on coding until today.

### Technology

I mainly do web development stuff, mainly full-stack web development in React. Using technology like NextJs and Create-T3-App. I have also tried VueJS with Nuxt. And I also uses astro for static site development, for example this site.

In addition to web development, I have also done quite a bit of algorithm and data structures in Python, as well as mobile app development in flutter.

For database management, while I am familar with SQL and will not have problem using raw SQL to query for data, I mainly uses Prisma ORM for the type security it provides when writing in TS.

### Hobbies

I play a lot of video games in my free time, at the time of writting I play a lot of Teamfight Tactitcs and Counter-Strike 2. The competitiveness of these games really attract me and I love the satisfaction from climbing up the ladder, though these satisfaction doesn't come quite often as I am not the best at gaming.

I am also a music enjoyer, I enjoy Taiwanese Indie Music, as it provides a lot of variety and depth and music genre. I also play instruments, I have started playing drums 7 years ago and I also picked up guitar in this summer and aims to cover at least one song from a Taiwan band this year.

### Why I Built This Site

There are 3 reasons behind building this site, first is to try astro out and see how the development experience is like building a full website. Second is to have a personal site to show off projects that I have build dynamically. And thrid is to practice my writting, I like writting a lot but I am quite bad at it so hopefully by writting some blog post here, I can improve my writting skills.
