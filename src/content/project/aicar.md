Participant of a year-long workshop led by Dr George Ng, Associate Lecturer in Data Science at Goldsmiths
University of London, I built a self-navigating model autonomous vehicle using a Raspberry Pi. And used Python,
TensorFlow, computer vision and the Keras library to build a machine learning model for the vehicle. This
experience allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of neural networks and other machine learning
concepts.
